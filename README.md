# WorldManager
Allows you to create interactiv Maps and Wikis for offline Worldbuilding.
project is currently still a work in progress but can do a some cool stuff already, you can try it by downloading [this .exe-File](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NfQSQeSxdIdQjNENNO-APp6Tx4v6_t5f/view?usp=share_link) which actually isnt a virus I just havent figured out how to inform windows about that as well.

## what it can do

Create and manage as many fictional worlds as you like, each one is safed in its own file which you can encrypt and send arround however you want (yes im using json for this dont shame me)
Get started by simply creating a new world by clicking the new button and entering a valid name. This world will be saved in the C:/users/[yourname]/documents/WorldManager directory.

You can now upload any image youd like that will be used as your worlds map. To this map you can then add markers to. The markers come in 3 different sizes and can be moved arround and renamed, when clicked they link to a wiki entry.

In the Wiki you can see on the left, a list of wiki entries in which you can each write text using the editorJS libary.
